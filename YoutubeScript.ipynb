It draws parallels between the exclusivity of literacy in the past, limited to a select few, and the current concentration of AI expertise in the hands of skilled engineers at major tech companies. The high costs and specialized skills required for AI projects have created barriers to entry for smaller businesses and individuals, hindering their ability to leverage AI technology effectively.\n",

A contrast is drawn between AI projects that primarily benefit large tech corporations and those that have the potential to empower smaller businesses operating outside the traditional internet and tech sectors.\n",
